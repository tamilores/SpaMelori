           You might talk about your origin story, your team, highlight awards or recognitions, or share photos. Tap into your creativity. You’ve got this. The way you tell your story online can make all the difference. <br><br>
           Don’t worry about sounding professional. Sound like you. There are over 1.5 billion websites out there, but your story is what’s going to separate this one from the rest. If you read the words back and don’t hear your own voice in your head, that’s a good sign you still have more work to do.

           <b>Hand Disinfection</b><br>
           Before beginning each service, all Spa Belles professionals are required to disinfect their hands with liquid sanitizer. This process prevents the spread of common germs to give you a peace of mind.<br><br>
           <b>Sanitation and Sterilization</b><br>
           Spa Belles has a staff that specializes in sanitizing and sterilizing the facility and equipment. After each client, our staff will clean the pedicure chairs, tabletops, and all other facility equipment with hospital-grade sanitizers to ensure your comfort and safety.<br><br>
           <b>Personal Spa Belles Manicure Kit</b><br>
           At Spa Belles, we recommend that first-time customers purchase a personal “Manicure Kit” (for a nominal fee) to ensure a higher level of sanitation. Spa Belles will store the “Manicure Kit” at the Spa Belles location of your choice.<br><br>
